    "## Python programming further exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Some further, more advanced Python exercises to practice additional aspects of Python programming, including decorators, generators and web scraping. Please note, these are purely supplementary and do no contribute to your overall grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exercise 1**: Prime Number Generator - Write a generator function called prime_generator that generates prime numbers. The generator should yield the next prime number each time it is called. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently generate prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exercise 2**: Decorator for Logging Function Calls - Create a decorator called log_function_calls that logs the details of each function call. The decorator should print the function name, the arguments passed to the function, and the return value of the function. Apply this decorator to a few sample functions and observe the logged output when calling those functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exercise 3**: File Encryption/Decryption using Context Managers - Implement a context manager called encrypt_file that encrypts the contents of a file and a context manager called decrypt_file that decrypts the contents of a file. Use symmetric encryption algorithms like AES or DES to perform the encryption and decryption. Use the context managers to encrypt a file and then decrypt it to verify the data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exercise 4**: Custom Iterator for Fibonacci Sequence - Create a custom iterator class called FibonacciIterator that generates the Fibonacci sequence. The iterator should return the next number in the sequence each time it is called. Implement the iter() and next() methods in the class to define the iterator behavior. Test the iterator by iterating over it and printing the Fibonacci numbers up to a specified limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exercise 5**: Web Scraper - Write a Python script that uses the Beautiful Soup or Selenium library to scrape data from a website. Choose a website of your choice and write code to extract specific information from the web page, such as headlines, article titles, or product prices. Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML content and retrieve the desired information."
